In other words, interval data has a scale that allows for the comparison of the sizes of differences between values. An example of interval data is temperature, where the difference between 20 and 30 degrees Celsius is the same as the difference between 30 and 40 degrees Celsius.\n",

    "\n",
    "The main difference between interval and ratio data is the presence or absence of a true zero point. Ratio data has a true zero point, which represents the complete absence of the attribute being measured. Interval data, on the other hand, does not have a true zero point, meaning that zero does not indicate the complete absence of the attribute being measured.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, interval and ratio data are two types of quantitative data in statistics. Interval data has a meaningful scale where the difference between values is meaningful, while ratio data has a meaningful scale where the ratio between values is meaningful and has a true zero point.\n",

    " - Temperature (in Celsius or Fahrenheit)\n",
    " - IQ score\n",
    " - Time (in seconds, minutes, or hours)\n",
    " - pH level\n",
    " - Calendar dates (days, months, years)\n",
    " - Longitude and latitude coordinates\n",

    " - Time (in seconds or other units)\n",

    " - Income\n",
    " - Number of items or units\n",
    " - Blood pressure\n",
    " - Speed\n",

    "It is important to note that the same variable can be considered interval or ratio depending on the context. For example, when measuring length, it can be considered interval data if we are using a measurement scale where zero is arbitrary (e.g. Celsius temperature scale), but it is ratio data if we are using a measurement scale where zero is absolute and represents the complete absence of the attribute being measured (e.g. weight in kilograms)."

    "Measures of central tendency are used to describe the center of a distribution or dataset. The three most common measures of central tendency are the mean, median, and mode.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Mean: The mean is the most commonly used measure of central tendency, and it is calculated by adding up all the values in a dataset and dividing by the total number of values. \n",

    " The formula for the mean is:\n",

    "\n",
    " - Limitations: The mean is sensitive to extreme values or outliers, which can distort its value.\n",

    "\n",
    " - Mode: The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. A dataset can have one mode, more than one mode, or no mode at all. \n",

    "\n",
    "Limitations of measures of central tendency: It is important to note that while measures of central tendency provide useful information about the center of a distribution, they do not provide any information about the spread or variability of the data. Additionally, measures of central tendency can be influenced by outliers or skewed distributions, so it is important to consider other measures, such as the range or standard deviation, to gain a more complete understanding of the data."
